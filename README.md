# Only Hands - Touch Screen Emulation Camera

## Description

Only Hands is a startup project designed to turn non-touch screens into touch-enabled displays. The camera, which attaches to the corner of your monitor, uses computer vision to track finger movements and emulate mouse clicks. This allows users to interact with their screen by simply touching it, creating a more intuitive and engaging experience.

# Please Note:
 The project is currently closed due to an issue with non-touch screens not being designed for touch use. When used as a touch interface, these screens can develop black spots after prolonged contact. Additionally, the landing page was primarily designed with mobile devices in mind, and the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX) are not fully optimized for desktop views.
